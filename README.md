# Computational Linguistics 
This is my repository for the Computational Lingustics course, spring 2023, at Aarhus University. The script performs a classifcation, using machine learning, of depression and non-depression labelled posts from *Reddit*. It also finds the most information words the model used to perform the classification. Lastly, it performs sentiment analysis to see whether the posts are overall more possitive, negative, or neutral. The outputs of the script are saved to the ```out``` folder.

## Usage ```depression.ipynb```
To run the code you should:
- Pull this repository with this folder structure.
- Make sure your working directory is set to ```src``` where the script is because the paths are set accordingly.
